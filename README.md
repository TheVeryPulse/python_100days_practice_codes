# Python Practice Codes
These are my Python practice projects. On average, each project is hours' worth of effort.

So far I have learned and practiced:
- Environment variables (day 35, 38)
- API (day 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39)
- Tkinter, GUI (day 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 34)
- pandas (day 25, 26, 31, 32)
- class, class inheritance (day 20, 21, 23, 34, 39)
- modules: requests, smtplib, json, datetime
