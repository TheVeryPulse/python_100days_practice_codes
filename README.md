# Python Practice Codes
These are my Python practice projects from the App Brewery online course. Each day's project is approximately over 2 hours' worth of effort.

So far I have learned:
- Tkinter, GUI (day 27, 28, 29)
- pandas (day 25, 26)
- read/write file (day 24)
- class, class inheritance (day 20, 21, 23)
