# Python Practice Codes
These are my Python practice projects. On average, each day's project is approximately over 2 hours' worth of effort.

So far I have learned:
- Environment variables (day 35)
- API (day 33, 34, 35)
- .json files handling (day 30)
- Tkinter, GUI (day 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 34)
- pandas (day 25, 26, 31, 32)
- class, class inheritance (day 20, 21, 23, 34)
- modules: smtplib, datetime
