# Python Practice Codes
These are my Python practice projects from the App Brewery online course. Each day's project is approximately over 2 hours' worth of effort.

So far I have learned:
- .json files handling (day 30)
- Tkinter, GUI (day 27, 28, 29, 30)
- pandas (day 25, 26)
- read/write file (day 24)
- class, class inheritance (day 20, 21, 23)

## Capstone projects:

- [Turtle Crossing Game](https://github.com/TheVeryPulse/python_practice_codes/tree/main/day_023_turtle_crossing_street)
- [Black Jack Game](https://github.com/TheVeryPulse/python_practice_codes/tree/main/day_011_black_jack)
