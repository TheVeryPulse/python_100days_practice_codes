# Python Practice Codes
These are my Python practice projects. On average, each project is hours' worth of effort.

So far I have learned and built projects of:
- Web scraping & interaction (day 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50)
- HTML, CSS (day 41, 42, 43, 44)
- API (day 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 46, 47)
- Tkinter, GUI (day 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 34)
- pandas (day 25, 26, 31, 32)
- class, class inheritance (day 20, 21, 23, 34, 39, 40)
- modules: selenium, requests, smtplib, json, datetime
